DESCRIPTION:

WPSac (Workplace Shell Access Control) is a tool that restricts access to the workplace shell to users with a configured user id (comparable with the WinNT logon). It also enables the administrator to restrict access to objects inside the workplace shell of a user. Users may share a workplace shell or use their own. Also it is able to logon to other tools or the LAN via the "Single signon feature".
