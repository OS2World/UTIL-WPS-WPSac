INIT Program
============

This program was build for test purposes only. It is useful to show
the kind of interface necessary to feed a SAC-file into the the
authorize component of WPSAC. This interface is normally used by 
"SAMMY.EXE", our login frontend, but for debugging and testing
purpose we build that small tool.

We include this file in binary (exe) form as well as in source code.
